You will of course need an installed Erlang/OTP environment.

To build the system and documentation:

	$ make

To build developer documentation:

	$ make all_doc

To run the test suites:

	$ make test

This requires that Common Test and Test Server are installed 
and in your path.  Quick and easy method:

	$ cd ~/lib/erlang/lib
	$ common_test-*/install.sh `pwd`
	$ ln -s ~/lib/erlang/lib/common_test-*/priv/bin/run_test ~/bin
